# Code for reproducing the results of the manual evaluation

In order to run the evaluation, one has to simply call the annotator_eval script from the terminal. No Parameters are required. Before calling the script one should check the correctness of all paths included in the script to be set correctly.

The generated results will be written to the same folder the data is located in.

The whole script is merely a quick working function not optimized in any way.
